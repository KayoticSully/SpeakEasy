License
=======
I have not yet decided what I will license this project under.  For now I will say that I am reserving all rights just for leagal reasons.
The liscense I choose will most like be along the lines of free to use as long as you are not selling something the code is involved in,
otherwise just contact me to work something out.

This will be more clear once I officially add proper licensing.

And as always, please reference my work if you use it.
